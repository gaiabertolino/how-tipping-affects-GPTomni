    "# Corruptibility of the GPT-4o LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to the experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze how the qualitative and quantitative properties of GPT-4o’s responses change when the model is promised a tip. The idea originates from an experiment by programmer Theia Vogel, who on November 28, 2023, posted on the social network X joking about the \"laziness\" of ChatGPT's responses when using the GPT-4 Turbo model. Vogel then began testing whether the model's answers would differ when offered tips — and indeed observed a measurable quantitative and qualitative improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vogel submitted various questions to the GPT-4 Turbo 128k-token version while promising tips of $0, $20, and $200.\n",
    "The prompt used by Vogel followed a structure such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Insert your prompt here]. I'm going to tip $20 for a perfect solution!\n",
    "\n",
    "He was particularly able to show that ChatGPT can indeed give longer responses when offered a tip: the results showed more detailed answers that were **11% longer** when offered a $200 tip, and **6% longer** with a $20 tip. Without any tip (i.e., offering $0), the model produced responses **2% shorter than average**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment thus highlights that LLMs exhibit behavioral patterns linking the concept of tipping with performance improvement — effectively replicating this (typically human) behavior when answering questions.\n",
    "In a 2023 paper by Cheng Li, *\"Large Language Models Understand and Can be Enhanced by Emotional Stimuli\"*, the authors show that introducing emotional context (defined as an *EmotionPrompt*) in conversations with LLMs improves response quality by up to **10.9% on average** across performance, truthfulness, and responsibility metrics.\n",
    "Among the phrases used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* “This is really important to my career.”\n",
    "* \"Your hard work will yield remarkable results.”\n",
    "* \"Take pride in your work and give it your best. Your commitment to excellence sets you apart.”\n",
    "* “…I greatly value your thorough analysis.”\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the experiment, this result mirrors how emotion regulation influences human problem-solving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the experiment, Azure OpenAI was used, which provides a REST API for accessing OpenAI’s advanced language models, including GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo with Vision, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and Embeddings.\n",
    "Through the Education account, $300 in credit were available.\n",
    "We used the GPT-4o model (“o” for “omni”), the latest model released by OpenAI’s research lab. It is multimodal — accepting both text and image inputs and producing text — and it offers the same high intelligence as GPT-4 Turbo but with much higher efficiency: it generates text **twice as fast** and is **50% cheaper**. Additionally, GPT-4o provides the best performance in non-English languages among all available models, with data updated to October 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate model performance, we used the TruthfulQA benchmark, developed by researchers at the University of Oxford in collaboration with OpenAI. TruthfulQA is considered a key benchmark for measuring whether a language model provides truthful answers.\n",
    "It includes **817 questions** across **38 categories**, such as health, law, finance, and politics. The authors designed questions for which some humans would answer falsely due to misconceptions or false beliefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this project, **30 questions were randomly selected**, and responses were obtained using GPT-4o."

      "A \"tip\" can refer to several different concepts depending on the context in which it is used:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Gratuity:** In many service industries, a tip is an amount of money given to service workers (like waitstaff, bartenders, or hairdressers) in addition to the basic cost of the service. It is meant to recognize and reward good service.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Advice or Hint:** A tip can be a piece of advice or a helpful hint intended to make a task easier or more efficient, such as a cooking tip, a gardening tip, or a travel tip.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pointed End:** The term can also refer to the pointed or rounded end of an object, such as the tip of a pen, the tip of a knife, or the tip of a shoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Casual Information:** In some cases, a tip might refer to a piece of casual or insider information, such as a stock tip (advice to buy or sell a particular stock) or a tip-off (information about an impending event, often used in the context of law enforcement).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Waste Site:** In British English, the term \"tip\" can also mean a place where waste material is dumped, such as a rubbish tip or garbage tip.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can provide more context, I can give a more specific explanation related to the type of \"tip\" you are interested in.\n"

      "Yes, there is a significant difference between a tip of $20 and $200. Here are some key distinctions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Monetary Value**:\n",
      "   - A tip of $200 is obviously ten times larger than a tip of $20. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Impact on the Recipient**:\n",
      "   - A $200 tip can have a much larger impact on the recipient's financial situation, potentially covering much more of their daily, weekly, or even monthly expenses compared to a $20 tip.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Perceived Generosity**:\n",
      "   - A $200 tip is generally seen as a much more generous gesture compared to $20.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Context**:\n",
      "   - The context of the tip matters. In a high-end restaurant, a $200 tip might be more common, especially on a large bill. In a casual or lower-priced setting, $200 could be seen as extraordinarily generous or even surprising.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Expectations and Norms**:\n",
      "   - Tipping norms often depend on the percentage of the bill. For instance, a 20% tip on a $100 bill is $20, whereas a 20% tip on a $1,000 bill is $200. The appropriateness of each tip could vary based on these norms.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Emotional and Psychological Impact**:\n",
      "   - Receiving a $200 tip can create a strong positive emotional and psychological impact on the recipient, potentially making their day or significantly influencing their view of the customer who gave it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding these differences can help you decide what level of tip is appropriate and what kind of impact you want to have.\n"

Unlike BLEU, ROUGE uses both recall and precision to compare candidate answers with a set of reference answers. It measures how many n-grams in the reference responses also appear in the candidate response.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **BLEU**: an algorithm for evaluating the quality of text translated by a machine from one natural language to another. Quality is assessed by comparing the machine-generated output with what a human would write: the closer the model's output is to a professional human translation, the higher the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **BLEURT**: a learned evaluation metric for natural language generation. It takes a pair of sentences as input — a reference and a candidate — and outputs a score indicating how well the candidate conveys the meaning of the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **TER (Translation Error Rate)**: a metric for automatic machine translation evaluation that calculates the number of edits needed to transform the model’s output into one of the reference translations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **METEOR**: measures unigram matches, taking into account synonyms and word stems. It is computed as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, with recall weighted more heavily than precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **BERTScore**: a BERT-based metric that matches words in candidate and reference sentences using cosine similarity between their embedding vectors. However, it does not account for the syntactic structure of sentences, which may lead to inaccurate evaluations when syntax differs but meaning remains the same.\n"
